gemini 2.0 flash experimental experiment with virtual machines in browser.

gemini api key is required however it is free so it shouldn't be a problem.

run a virtual machine in your browser and get help with gemini with anything.

you could also use this as a reference of how to use copy.sh/v86 builds outside of copy.sh so you don't have to keep local builds that are gonna get easily out of date
